boolean_conjunction_prediction.py
- implements functions required to predict the formula of conjunction of boolean literals from training data, measure / estimate errors related to the same
- Ref: https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/mlbook/ [second edition, Example 2.6 (Conjunction of Boolean literals)], modified slightly to also allow detecting inability to predict a well defined hypothesis from avalable samples.

rademacher_complexity.py
- implements function to find rademacher complexity of a set and rademacher complexity of a function class
- Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rademacher_complexity
